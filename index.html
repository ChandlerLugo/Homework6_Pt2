<h3 style="color:white"> Data Description </h3>
<p style="color:white"> This data describes the population of different ethinicities in the state of Florida in 2021.  </p>
<h2 style="color:white"> Ratio </h2>
<p style="color:white"> For these maps, I used the ratio of Hispanic or Latino People in Florida 
Counties to the total population of the counties. I looked at this ratio on a scale of 10,000 people.
To create this ratio, I added a new column the total population's attribute table in which 
I divided the total population number for each county by that county's Hispanic or Latino population. Then, 
I multiplied this decimal number by 10,000 to get an accurate integer for the number of Hispanic or Latino 
people per 10,000 people. </p>

<h2 style="color:white">Natural Breaks Categorization</h2>
<p style="color:white"> This categorization is good for showing cluster data. It uses natural breaks 
in the numbers of the data to assign colors. It is useful for seeing outliers and groups of data, and it is 
useful if there is a large distribution of data. It is limited, however, by its inconsistency. It is not the 
most readable way to share data. </p>

<h2 style="color:white">Equal Interval Categorization</h2>
<p style="color:white"> This categorization evenly divided the data into 5 intervals. This is a positive
because it maintains an equal distribution and can show a good scale of the data if it has a large difference between 
the highest and lowest numbers. However, if there are a lot of values clustered in one category, it can be very hard
to tell the difference between them. Another limitation is that this categorization can create intervals for values that
are not represented on the map. </p>

<h2 style="color:white">Equal Count Categorization</h2>
<p style="color:white"> This categorization has an even amount counties within each interval. This is useful for helping us
get the median of the data and visualizing what is above and below the median. The biggest limitation of this categorization is that
there may be two areas or counties that have very similar values but end up in different intervals in order to maintain an equal count. </p>
